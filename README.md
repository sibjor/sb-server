- Note: CMake is used to generate a compile_commands.json for VSCode ClangD usage.

## About 

The C++ version is refactored from the C implementation which follows the tutorial linked above.

I chose to refactor a C tutorial I had stumbled upon earlier intended to be applied to act as a HTTP server software running on my Raspberry Pi 5 8GB at home on a 1000/mbit fibre connection hosting one or several of my domains. My thoughts is that it could possibly be expanded wrapping future assignments such as portfolio/frontend network & graphics/physics/game programming on one single environment hosting the projects products as well as source code and free licence publicly on the internet. However, the mission given by our teacher this time is cited: ___"When we refactor, we do not add new features to our code, nor do we solve problems or hunt for bugs: we only change it in ways that make it easier to read and maintain."___ Therefore, I will expand the project through separate git submodules, not interfering with the demands stated above.

## Why/What I've refactored (or To Be):

- [ ] Extend the file descriptor "server_fd"
